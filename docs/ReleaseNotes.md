# Cerebro Release Notes

## Overview

Cerebro is a specialized desktop application for CS students to track internship applications, built upon the foundation of AddressBook Level 3 (AB3). While maintaining AB3's CLI-first approach optimized for fast typists, Cerebro has been completely reimagined to address the specific needs of managing internship application pipelines.

---

## Purpose Transformation

**From:** General-purpose contact management for any users
**To:** Specialized internship application tracking for CS students

This fundamental shift drives all feature changes and enhancements detailed below.

---

## Major New Features

### 1. **Application Status Tracking System**
A comprehensive status management system to track your entire internship application journey:

- **New `status` Command:** Quick-update application status with `status INDEX s/STATUS`
- **9 Predefined Status Values (Case insensitive):**
    - `to-apply` - Not yet applied (default)
    - `applied` - Application submitted
    - `oa` - Online Assessment stage
    - `tech-interview` - Technical interview
    - `hr-interview` - HR/behavioral interview
    - `in-process` - General process stage
    - `offered` - Internship offer received
    - `accepted` - Offer accepted
    - `rejected` - Application rejected
- **Visual Pipeline Tracking:** See your entire application pipeline at a glance
- **Status Integration:** Status field integrated into `add` and `edit` commands

**Examples:**
```
status 1 s/tech-interview
status 3 s/offered
add n/Google s/applied
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/StatusDemo1.png" alt="status 1 s/tech-interview" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/StatusDemo2.png" alt="result for status command" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 2. **Flexible Company Entry System**
Companies can now be added with minimal information and expanded later:

- **Name-Only Entry:** `add n/Google Inc` creates entry with just company name
- **Optional Fields:** All fields except name are now optional
- **Smart Defaults:** Placeholder values auto-filled for omitted fields
- **Incremental Updates:** Add basic info quickly, fill details later with `edit`

**Comparison:**
- **AB3:** Required name, phone, email, and address for every contact
- **Cerebro:** Only company name required; build your entry incrementally, can still add all at once if you'd like

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/UpdatedAddDemo1.png" alt="add n/Google e/google@gmail.com p/67676767" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/UpdatedAddDemo2.png" alt="result for updated add command" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 3. **New Remark System**
A dedicated command for managing application notes:

- **New `remark` Command:** `remark INDEX r/[REMARK]`
- **Add/Edit/Delete:** Full CRUD operations for remarks
- **Use Cases:** Track referrals, company culture notes, application tips, deadlines
- **Empty Remark Deletion:** Use `remark INDEX r/` to remove remarks

**Examples:**
```
remark 1 r/Great company culture, flexible hours
remark 2 r/Referral from John Doe
remark 3 r/
```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="images/RemarkDemo1.png" alt="remark 1 r/Great company culture, flexible hours" /></td>
    <td><img src="images/RemarkDemo2.png" alt="result for remark command" /></td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 4. **Batch Operations**
Powerful bulk editing and deletion capabilities for efficient management:

#### **Batch Edit**
- **Comma-Separated:** `edit 1,3,5 s/rejected`
- **Range Edit:** `edit 2-4 s/applied t/tech`
- **Hybrid:** `edit 1,3-5 s/applied`
- **Batch Fields:** Status, tags, and remarks can be edited in bulk
- **Use Case:** Update multiple applications that moved to the same stage

#### **Batch Delete**
- **Comma-Separated:** `delete 1,3,5`
- **Range Delete:** `delete 2-4`
- **Hybrid:** `delete 1,3-5 s/applied`
- **Duplicate Handling:** Duplicate indices automatically ignored

**Comparison:**
- **AB3:** Single-entry edit and delete only
- **Cerebro:** Multi-entry operations with comma and range syntax

## New FAQ Entries

**Q: What happens if I add a company with the same name as an existing one?**
A: Company names must be unique (case-insensitive). Cerebro will reject duplicates with an error message.

**Q: Can I undo a delete or clear operation?**
A: No, these operations are permanent. Restore from your `addressbook.json` backup if needed.

**Q: What's the difference between `status` and `edit` for updating status?**
A: `status` is a quick single-purpose command, while `edit` allows multi-field updates. Use whichever is convenient!

---

## Maintained Known Issues

The following known issues from AB3 remain in Cerebro:

1. **Multi-screen GUI positioning** - GUI may open off-screen after switching from secondary to primary screen
    - **Remedy:** Delete `preferences.json` before restarting

2. **Help Window minimization** - Minimized help window doesn't reopen on subsequent `help` commands
    - **Remedy:** Manually restore the minimized window

---

## Future Enhancements (v2.0)

**Planned Features:**
- Data archiving functionality (Undo your delete/clear commands)
- Advanced filtering by status, tags, or date ranges
- Improved search by not requiring exact word match
