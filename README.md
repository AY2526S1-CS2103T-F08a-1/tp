**Cerebro** is a desktop CLI app for Computer Science students managing **multiple internship applications efficiently**. Built for users who type fast, and prefer **keyboard-driven** workflows over point-and-click workflows.

**Key Features:**
  - Track internship applications (company details, application status, tags, remarks)
  - Filter companies by status (`applied`, `tech-interview`, `offered`, etc.) and tags
  - Batch operations: update or delete multiple entries at once (`edit 1,3,5-7`, `delete 1-4`)
  - Quick search by company name with flexible substring matching
  - Status distribution metrics dashboard for application progress overview
  - Comprehensive CLI with keyboard shortcuts and command history navigation

The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Cerebro_) used for **managing internship progress**.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base.
  * It comes with a reasonable level of **user** and **developer** documentation. 
  * For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Cerebro Product Website](https://ay2526s1-cs2103t-f08a-1.github.io/tp/)**. 
  * This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
